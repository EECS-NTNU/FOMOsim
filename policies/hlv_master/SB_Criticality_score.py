Calculates the criticality score for a location to be visited by a vehicle.
Criticality score is based on:
- Time to violation = How long is it until a starvation/congestion appears
- Deviation from target state = The difference from the locations inventory and the current target state
- Neighborhood criticality = How much can neighboring locations affect the current locations criticality
- Demand = How the current demand contributes to the criticality
- Driving time = The time it takes for the vehicle to arrive contributes to the criticality
